    "<b>1. Understand the Root Causes</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Long waiting times in hospitals can be caused by a wide range of factors—such as staff shortages, inefficient scheduling systems, limited resources, or poor patient flow management. Scoping the problem helps identify exactly where the issues lie so that targeted solutions can be developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>2. Prioritize Patient Care and Safety</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Delays in treatment can lead to worsening health conditions, increased anxiety, and even life-threatening situations for some patients. Understanding this problem allows healthcare providers to improve patient outcomes and satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>3. Improve Hospital Efficiency</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "When wait times are long, hospital systems become congested, resources are strained, and staff productivity suffers. Scoping the problem helps streamline operations and enhance overall hospital performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>4. Support Policy Making and Investment</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Accurate problem scoping provides data and insights needed by policymakers, hospital administrators, and investors to make informed decisions—whether it’s about hiring more staff, investing in technology, or restructuring services.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>5. Enable Innovation and Tech Solutions</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the problem is clearly scoped, it becomes easier to design innovative solutions—such as AI-based scheduling, smart queue systems, or mobile apps to improve patient flow and reduce waiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>6. Ensure Equity in Healthcare Access</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Long waiting times often disproportionately affect vulnerable populations (e.g., the elderly, low-income patients). Problem scoping helps highlight such inequalities and guide efforts toward fairer healthcare access.\n",
